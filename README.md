# Unity Components
Various useful MonoBehaviour components for Unity.

## Use
By default this package comes with several useful components like DontDestroyOnLoad, a generic Singleton implementation, and a Note component for adding development notes in the inspector.

It also comes with several inheritable UI component base classes for quicker scripting. Need a script that gets a Canvas, Button, or Image reference? Inherit from CanvasComponent, ButtonComponent, ImageComponent or others!

This package is even more useful when used in conjunction with the [Unity Variables](https://github.com/Grimbar-Interactive/unity-variables) and [Unity State](https://github.com/Grimbar-Interactive/unity-state) packages.
When these packages are added to a project you can use state and boolean-based canvas enablers to build out a powerful UI system from simple and flexible components.
