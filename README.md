# Unity UI Components
Various useful MonoBehaviour components for building interfaces using Unity UI (UGUI) and other Grimbar packages.

## Use
This package comes with several inheritable UI component base classes for quicker scripting. Need a script that gets a Canvas, Button, or Image reference? Inherit from CanvasComponent, ButtonComponent, ImageComponent or others!

The package also has components that utilize the [Unity Variables](https://github.com/Grimbar-Interactive/unity-variables) and [Unity State](https://github.com/Grimbar-Interactive/unity-state) packages.
When these packages are added to a project you can use state and boolean-based canvas enablers to build out a powerful UI system from simple and flexible components.
